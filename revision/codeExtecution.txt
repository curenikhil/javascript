// How code executed in Js

3 Phase: Global, function and Eval

whenever a js code run creates :
step1: Global exection context 
in browser refers: window
in evironment refers: this

step 2: funtion exectuion context 
this divided in 2 parts
Part 1: Memory phase 
here, the definiton of vairable loaded with undefined value
for Function, defention is parsed 

part 2: exection context 
here, follow callstack (lifo : last in first out execution )
where final output assigned or refers to Golbal execution context



CASE: when there is nested function or function holded varialbes : 
specifically,, new sandbox environment created for them; which further deleted after completion and retrun values to gloabl object by there scope prespective
