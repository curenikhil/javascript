// this is about how code executed in javascript`
/*
1. global execution context
- comes this - which id for browser which is once only

2. A. Memory creation Phase
- here only memory for the variable defined not the values

2. B. Execution Phase 
- whenever the function declared, it loads the definiton of the function and return to the global

process two always executed

if there is any another variable inside the execution phase
then another sandbox created where process two repeated and the values 
returned to gloabal object - and we called it 
"New variable environment and need a thread because javascript works only on threads"
